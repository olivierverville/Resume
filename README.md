# Resume

Hi, my name is Olivier Verville, and this repository is used as my online resume. As far back as I can remember, I've always had interest for computers; as soon as I was introduced to them, I loved it, and it's been a big part of my life since then. My interest for programming came a few years later as I was exploring this vast and amazing world that would forever change my vision of the world around me.

Even though programming is my area of expertise, I love pretty much everything IT-related. Whenever I find the occasion to, I'll mess around and undertake minor projects in areas such as networking, hardware, IoT, GFX editing, etc. If I get to do a little of programming while I'm at it, well I call it the best of both worlds.

Completed Projects
---

**October 2017 — March 2018**

**Title:** Developer & Automation Engineer  
**Employer**: Askida  
**For:** Banking Company

**Project:** Conversion of a legacy app that automated an internal banking app (like a bot) from VBA, to a Python webservice. The internal banking app was converted into a web app from a previous project, and so their VBA automation app broke. It was converted into a local webservice (written in Python). The webservice uses selenium & chromedriver to reproduce the automation that was done in the legacy VBA app. The webservice exposed a simple REST API, and the legacy VBA code was patched to make requests to this API.

In parallel I was also responsible for setting up the architecture behind our internal automated tests (API tests) and setting up the whole thing on Jenkins (build app, launch webservice, start tests, etc.). The actual test cases and scripts weren't written by me.

**Tags**: `Python 3` , `Selenium` , `ChromeDriver` , `WebService` , `REST API` , `VBA`, `MS Access`, `Jenkins`

**October 2017 — December 2017**

**Title:** CI Automation Engineer  
**Employer**: Askida  
**For:** Development Company

**Project:** Automation of a complex build procedure on a PowerBuilder application. The procedure was previously done manually on a weekly basis and was time consuming (~3 hours, given the procedure was executed by someone used to it)

**Tags**: `CI/CD` , `PowerBuilder` , `PowerGen` , `TeamCity`, `Python 3`

**June 2017 — August 2017**

**Title:** Automation Engineer & QA analyst  
**Employer**: Askida  
**For:** Security Company

**Project:** Design and development of a BDD-oriented automated test architecture for an internal application. The test architecture was built on top of the Python framework Behave (Cucumber clone). I also was responsible for the writing and scripting of basic test scenarios. The framework was targeted for API tests on a SOAP API.

**Tags**: `Python 2` , `BDD` , `Behave` ,  `SOAP API`

**April 2016 — May 2017**

**Title:** QA Analyst & Developer  
**Employer**: Askida  
**For:** Banking Company

**Project:** Conversion of an internal banking app (written in MicroFocus COBOL, in 1983), to a Java web application. The backend was written in Java and used an Oracle database, and the frontend was entirely written in TypeScript. I worked the first 6 months on the project as a QA analyst, building up the test architecture, the setup on Jenkins, and developing an internal testing library for Robot Framework, which was the framework used for the scripting of the test cases (keyword driven approach). I spent the rest of the project as a developer, developing utility tools for the COBOL to Java conversion, creation of transaction stubs, and a few other things that saved hundreds of hours of work. Also participated to the actual development of the application.

**Tags**: `Java` , `TypeScript` , `Robot Framework` , `Python 2` , `Jenkins` , `Oracle` , `SQL` , `COBOL`
